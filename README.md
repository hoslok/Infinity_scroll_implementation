Infinite Scroll Implementation in React

This is a simple implementation of Infinity Scroll in React. 
It uses the EnglishVilla Entertainment News API endpoint to fetch data. The paginated API data is called whenever the user reaches the bottom of the page. 
Once the new data is made available, the next page loads and scrolling is enabled.
